## Introduction
Enterprise integration has evolved significantly over the years, with various architectural patterns emerging to solve different integration challenges. This article aims to clarify the distinctions between Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), while providing guidance on when to use each approach in modern enterprise environments.

## Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
SOA is an architectural paradigm that structures enterprise software resources as discoverable services across a network. Each service:
- Performs discrete units of work
- Achieves specific business objectives
- Maintains independence from other services
- Operates within distributed systems architecture

### Evolution of SOA
