## Enterprise Service Bus (ESB): The Backbone of Standard-Based Integration

Welcome to Part 3 of our Enterprise Integration Architecture series. In [Part 2](/2025/05/08/enterprise-integration-part2-eai/), we explored Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) approaches. This article focuses on the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), a more distributed and standards-based integration architecture that emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional EAI solutions.

## What is an Enterprise Service Bus?

An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) represents a modern integration infrastructure specifically designed to facilitate service-oriented communication between diverse applications. Unlike traditional EAI, which focuses on application integration, ESB emphasizes service integration and standards-based interoperability.

### ESB Core Principles
