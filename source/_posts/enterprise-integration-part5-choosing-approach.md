## Choosing the Right Integration Approach: Decision Frameworks and Migration Strategies

Welcome to the final article in our Enterprise Integration Architecture series. In our previous articles, we explored [Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)](/2025/05/08/enterprise-integration-part2-eai/), [Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)](/2025/05/15/enterprise-integration-part3-esb/), and [Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)](/2025/05/22/enterprise-integration-part4-soa/). This article provides comprehensive guidance on selecting the most appropriate integration architecture for your specific needs, along with practical migration strategies and future trends.

## Integration Architecture Decision Framework
