Integrity:

At all times, I will act with integrity. This means that I must do what I believe to be right.  I will discern what is right by listening to my inner voice. I will be guided by that internal compass, irrespective of the external circumstances.

Truth:

In this way, he can be a beacon for others to follow. In this sense, truth means fairness. If I am fair, it will help my clients to define their goals and help them to achieve those goals in a manner which is fair - not only to themselves but to others as well.

Efficiency:

 In this context, efficiency means being able to do the most for my clients while keeping their best interests at heart. A person’s best interest is not necessarily served by getting the most, but rather by achieving balance so that a sustained solution can be maintained.

Wisdom:

Good advice involves more than legal expertise. I am more than a technician, trained in the law. It is the quality of my advice by which I will be judged. Technical problems must always be understood within a broader life context. Helping a client become clear about their situation is often the first step in resolving the problem.

Listening

In order to help my clients achieve their true objectives [which are not necessarily their stated objectives], I must come to understand where the person is coming from. This will come from listening to my clients and attempting to discern the hidden or root concern.

Respect

Technologist- client relationship is founded upon mutual respect. Too often, lawyers take a superior posture with their clients. By having compassion and being approachable, I can still command the respect of my clients. My clients should have respect for my legal expertise, just as I will have respect for their position and their need for consultation.

Clarity of mission

Having discerned the true objective of each client, I will have a certain mission with each client. This clarity of purpose will enable both the lawyer and client to benefit from their mutual association.

Assertiveness

Clients frequently confuse aggression with strength, thinking they need the former when they really need the latter. Assertiveness means having the strength of character to recognize and pursue the truth. It means standing up for what is fair while recognizing the attempts of other lawyers and clients to manipulate and exploit circumstances for selfish ends.

To have fun

There must always be balance in life. To be effective, it is important that I enjoy what I do. This means that I will maintain my sense of humour and not let my client’s problems drag me down. We all have a serious obligation not to take life too seriously.
